    "[As defined by ChatGPT] \n",
    "\n",
    "RAG, or Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a method used in natural language processing that combines \n",
    "retrieval-based and generative models to produce more informed and contextually relevant responses. RAG operates in two main \n",
    "steps: retrieval and generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieval: In this step, the model searches a large collection of documents or knowledge sources to find the most relevant \n",
    "and informative pieces of text that can help answer a given query. This is typically done using an efficient retrieval mechanism, \n",
    "such as dense vector representation or sparse term-based matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generation: With the retrieved documents or passages in hand, the model generates a response to the input query, conditioning \n",
    "on both the original query and the information gathered from the relevant documents. This allows the model to produce more accurate, \n",
    "detailed, and context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, RAG is a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both retrieval-based and generative models to provide better \n",
    "responses by incorporating external knowledge from large document collections or knowledge bases. \n",
    "\n",
    "[DC: Checks out!]\n",
